**SeqGrowGraph** incrementally builds a directed lane graph by adding one vertex at a time, expanding the adjacency matrix from **n×n** to **(n+1)×(n+1)** to encode connectivity, and serializing the evolving graph into sequences, inspired by human map-drawing processes for robust, efficient topology learning.

```
Add our projects to mmdetection3d projects
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MIV-XJTU/SeqGrowGraph.git
cp -r SeqGrowGraph mmdetection3d/projects/
cd mmdetection3d
```

## 📦 Data Preparation

1、Download nuScenes

Download the complete dataset from [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download) and extract it to `mmdetection3d/data/nuscenes`.

Or establish a soft connection：

```bash
mkdir data
ln -s /path/to/your/nuscenes data
```


2、Construct data

Run the following code to generate `.pkl` file.
```
python projects/SeqGrowGraph/tools/create_data_pon_centerline.py nuscenes
```


## 🚀 Train
See `projects/SeqGrowGraph/scripts/train.sh` for the code.

1、Pre-train

Begin by pretraining the model on a segmentation task.
```bash

./tools/dist_train.sh ./projects/SeqGrowGraph/configs/road_seg/lss_roadseg_48x32_b4x8_resnet_adam_24e.py $GPU_NUM

```

2、Train

Next, train the model for lane-graph learning.
```bash
./tools/dist_train.sh projects/SeqGrowGraph/configs/seq_grow_graph/seq_grow_graph_default.py $GPU_NUM
```

## 🎯 Test & Visualization
Run  `projects/SeqGrowGraph/scripts/test.sh` to perform inference on the test dataset without training. Please download the [ckpt](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/misstl/SeqGrowGraph) from ModelScope.

```bash
./tools/dist_test.sh projects/configs/seq_grow_graph/seq_grow_graph_default.py /path/to/your/checkpoint $GPU_NUM
```

## 📈 Evaluation
The test outputs can be validated independently using the scirpt.
```bash
python projects/SeqGrowGraph/seq_grow_graph/nus_metric_new.py --result_path /path/to/your/checkpoint
```
